## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a detailed explanation of elements that contribute to the look, feel and functionality of this project. 
Since this project features a large variety of components, ranging from simple themes to
entire applications, documentation will be organized into multiple categories based on the 
language the component is written in (plasmoids, applications) or the standard that defines it (themes). Components will categorized in the following way:

- **Themes**
    - [Plasma theme (Seven-Black)](./Documentation/Themes/Seven-Black.md)
    - [Window decoration theme (Emerald/Smaragd)](./Documentation/Themes/Smaragd-Theme.md)
- **Software**
    - Plasmoids
        - [System tray (org.kde.plasma.private.systemtray)](./Documentation/Software/Plasmoids/System-Tray.md)
        - [Desktop icons (org.kde.desktopcontainment)](./Documentation/Software/Plasmoids/DesktopContainment.md)
        - [SevenStart (io.gitgud.wackyideas.SevenStart)](./Documentation/Software/Plasmoids/SevenStart.md)
        - [SevenTasks (io.gitgud.wackyideas.seventasks)](./Documentation/Software/Plasmoids/SevenTasks.md)
    - KWin
        - [Smaragd](./Documentation/Software/KWin/Smaragd.md)
        - [Reflection effect](./Documentation/Software/KWin/Reflection.md)

To keep the documentation condensed and to prevent redundancy, components that don't require documentation or are out of scope for this project (as in, documentation exists elsewhere) will not be documented here:

- Date and time (io.gitgud.wackyideas.digitalclocklite)
- Show desktop (Aero) (io.gitgud.wackyideas.win7showdesktop)
- Keyboard switcher (org.kde.plasma.keyboardlayout)
- Look and Feel (Splash and Lock screen theme) (authui7)
- Plasma tooltip (DefaultToolTip.qml)
- Wine theme (Windows Style Builder)
- Color scheme ([KDE's docs](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/plasma-workspace/kcontrol/colors/index.html), [Video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VW--o7CEEA))
- Icon theme ([Freedesktop](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) [specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html))
- Cursor theme ([Freedesktop specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/cursor-spec/))
- Sound theme (KDE system settings)
- GTK2 theme ([GTK2](https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/GnomeArt/Tutorials/GtkThemes) [theme details](https://www.orford.org/gtk/))
- Kvantum theme* ([Kvantum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsujan/Kvantum/master/Kvantum/doc/Theme-Making.pdf) [documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsujan/Kvantum/master/Kvantum/doc/Theme-Config.pdf))

*While Kvantum won't be discussed here, one important detail worth mentioning is that Kvantum does not respect KDE's color schemes for the most part and that this sometimes leads to unexpected visual results. Still, it's recommended to apply a KDE color scheme alongside Kvantum for maximum compatibility.

In the future, some components might receive their dedicated documentation, in case it's required.

## List of components <a name="list-of-components"></a>

This is a list of components that are included in this project, as well as their completion status. Note that finished components are still subject to bugs, general enhancements and maintenance, but they are "more or less" feature complete. The forked column links to the original projects and their authors. Please consider taking a look at their work, because without them, this project would not be possible.
