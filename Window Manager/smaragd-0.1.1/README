Smaragd

Smaragd is a themable window decoration engine for KDE's KWin window manager.
It uses the original Emerald engines to render the decorations to support all
current Emerald themes.

Read INSTALL for installation and NOTES for usage hints.

See individual files for Copyright information.


To install the theme, you should put the kwin_smaragd.so file into the following directory
(This works on Arch Linux, I haven't tested on other distros)
/usr/lib/qt/plugins/org.kde.kdecoration2/kwin_smaragd.so
